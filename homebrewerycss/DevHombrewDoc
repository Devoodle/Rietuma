# Nagas
Nagas, up until recently, resided exclusively in two areas; the desert regions of the Southern Regions in small nomadic tribes, or on a recently discovered island to the west of Asturion. Both groups are new to the ways of Elians.

<br>

### Naga Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
Age. Like humans, naga reach adulthood in their late teens. They show no signs of aging beyond that point except for growing larger, so in theory, a naga could live well over a century.


***Alignment.*** Most desert naga tend towards lawful or neutral alignments, having grown up in traditionalist societies in the Southern deserts, but their western island-dwelling cousins tend more towards chaotic alignments.
Size. Naga stand about 5 feet tall when upright, but the total length of their bodies, head to tail, ranges from 10 to as much as 20 feet. Your size is Medium.


***Speed Burst.*** By lowering your body to the ground and propelling yourself with your arms, you can move more quickly for a time. As a bonus action on your turn, if you have both hands free, you can increase your walking speed by 5 feet until the end of your turn.


***Natural Weapons.*** Your fanged maw and constricting serpentine body are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.
    If you hit with your bite, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, and your target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 1d4 poison damage.
		Once per turn if you hit with your constrict attack, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, and you may make a free grapple attempt against the target using your tail. Until this grapple ends you cannot constrict another target.
		
***Poison Immunity.*** You are immune to poison damage and can’t be poisoned.


***Poison Affinity.*** You gain proficiency in the poisoner’s kit.


***Languages.*** You can speak, read and write Vahcian and either Naga or Sahran.

# Fire Newts
Fire Newts orginal hail from the elemental plane of fire. Because of this fact firenewts are wowed by the most mundane of things found on the material plane. For instance firenewts throw outrageously large parties every night as they are unused to the idea of a nighttime.
Firenewts are about the size of a small human. They appear like lizardfolk with simpler faces and larger, dark-colored eyes. Their speckled, smooth skin appear eel-like and bears the color of flames. Firenewt colors have increasing rarity from red to yellow to white to blue. Even more rare are purple newts and above that green newts. Solid colored newts are very rare. There are not any known solid purple or green newts. Firenewts have long feet, giving them the appearance of "reversed knees".

Despite some misconceptions, firenewts are not infact releated to lizards and are instead more related to amphibians.

Firenewts require a source of magma in order to breed. When they do they deposit their clutch of eggs and leave their young to fend for themselves, because of this reason, Firenewts are far more communal seeing all newts as their family. 

Firenewts are known to carry around the ingredients to make an alchemical concoction made from mineral salts, sulfur and oil which they turn into a paste and chew as a habit to aid in their spitting of flames and warms them internally when away from a heat source or home. Firenewts have a great love of Alcohol, cheese and shiny materials such as gemstones. They have an especially large love of items that are green and purple.

The damage increases to 3d8 at 6th level, 4d8 at 11th level, and 5d8 at 16th level.

After you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you complete a short Rest.

# Water Newts

For many Waternewts, they establish a goal to seek early on in their lives, a project that they refer to as their Opus. Waternewts will spend nearly their entire lives working on their Opus, this project can range from attempting to uncover an artifact to creating the greatest flower garden ever made. In waternewt culture in order to ascend to the afterlife and have eternal happiness they complete this project.

The process by which a waternewt picks their Opus is largely out of their control, A waternewts Opus comes to them early on via a dream, a sign, or some other third party source. This event is believed by many waternewts to be predetermined and made aware to them by their races latent divination talents. Newts who don't recieve such a goal are considered abandoned by the "the current" and are cast out from society.

Waternewt cities are a confusing blend of canals, tunnels, and wide open spaces that randomly split between underwater spaces and above spaces making naviagting them difficult for those who are unable to breath underwater, waternewt currency is based on trade bars rather then gold.

## Paladin - Oath of The Warden

The Oath of the Warden was founded after a schism in the Oath of the Watchers paladins. The members of what would become the Wardens believed that Oath of the Watchers did not go far enough to prevent extraplanar incursions, and that their principles and morals limited their capabilities. Dressed in unassuming grey, each warden operates in the shadows, dispensing righteous fury before the enemy even knows what hit them.  They are closely associated with the shadowy organization known as The Ministry.

#### Tenets of The Warden:
___
**Secure the Future.** You are the thin line between the material plane and fiendish takeover. All that stand in your way are accessory to the apocalypse and must be cast aside. Mercy, compassion, and justice are not principles, but tools to be discarded at your convenience.
___
**Secrecy.** It is imperative that you keep your identity secret from even your closest allies. What your enemies don’t know is your greatest tool.
___
**No Quarter.** Take no quarter from aberrations and fiends. Any found on the material plane must be killed in the most efficient way possible. Fey and Celestials should be treated with suspicion at best.

### Oath Spells
At 3rd level, and again at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, you gain
the spells listed in the Oath of the Warden Spells table. 
<img src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/522811853743718402/898436639418892308/wardenspells.png' style='position:relative;bottom:-10px;right:0px;width:300px' />
<br>
<br>
### Channel Divinity: Sacred Marksmanship
You can use your Channel Divinity to imbue up to two ranged weapons with holy power. As an action you
can touch up to two ranged weapons, granting them the following
properties for 8 hours. This effect ends early if you use it again
before its duration ends.
___
• The weapons are magical.
___
• If the weapons have the ammunition or loading property,
they no longer have those properties. The ammunition and
loading are provided magically.
___
• When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack
using the weapons, you can use your Divine Smite feature.
However, the damage dice for your Divine Smite feature
when used in this manner are d6s instead of d8s. 
### Channel Divinity: Warden’s Shadow
You can use your Channel Divinity to cloak
yourself from enemies. As an action you can take the Hide action
and have proficiency in the Stealth ability check made as a part of
the action. If you already have proficiency in Stealth, you instead
double your proficiency bonus for the ability check. 
### Baleful Aura
Beginning at 7th level, you can surround yourself with an aura that
wards off enemies that would get close to you. When a creature
attempts to move within 10 feet of you, you can choose (no action
required) to have it first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus
your spell save DC or be unable to willingly move within 10 feet
of you for the remainder of that turn. Creature that succeed on save
is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
___
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet
### Disciplined Mind
At 15th level, when you cast a spell that requires concentration,
you can immediately take a bonus action or action to fortify your
mind for the spell’s duration. While your mind is so fortified, if
you take damage you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on the spell. 
### Darkstalker
At 20th level, you can use your divine power to become an instrument of death. When you move, your body leaves behind a short
trail of grey fog, and your voice echoes with threatening tones in
the rare event you choose to speak.
Additionally, you can take an action to undergo a transformation
which lasts for 1 minute and grants you the following benefits.
___
• When you score a critical hit and use your Divine Smite
feature on the hit, it generates an explosion of divine energy
in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the target. Creatures of
your choice other than the creature targeted with the attack
within the affected area take radiant damage equal to the
radiant damage dealt by the attack.
___
• At the start of each of your turns, you gain a bonus to your
weapon attack and damage rolls equal to your Charisma
modifier, which lasts until the start of your next turn. This
benefit ends if you move or take any actions other than
making weapon attacks.
___
• When you kill a creature you can see, you can take a
reaction to seal its soul with a holy glyph that appears on
the target’s body. A creature so sealed cannot be returned
to life unless you give permission for it to do so. 
___
Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a
long rest.
