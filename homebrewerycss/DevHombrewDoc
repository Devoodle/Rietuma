# Nagas
Nagas, up until recently, resided exclusively in two areas; the desert regions of the Southern Regions in small nomadic tribes, or on a recently discovered island to the west of Asturion. Both groups are new to the ways of Elians.

<br>

### Naga Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
Age. Like humans, naga reach adulthood in their late teens. They show no signs of aging beyond that point except for growing larger, so in theory, a naga could live well over a century.


***Alignment.*** Most desert naga tend towards lawful or neutral alignments, having grown up in traditionalist societies in the Southern deserts, but their western island-dwelling cousins tend more towards chaotic alignments.
Size. Naga stand about 5 feet tall when upright, but the total length of their bodies, head to tail, ranges from 10 to as much as 20 feet. Your size is Medium.


***Speed Burst.*** By lowering your body to the ground and propelling yourself with your arms, you can move more quickly for a time. As a bonus action on your turn, if you have both hands free, you can increase your walking speed by 5 feet until the end of your turn.


***Natural Weapons.*** Your fanged maw and constricting serpentine body are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.
    If you hit with your bite, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, and your target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 1d4 poison damage.
		Once per turn if you hit with your constrict attack, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, and you may make a free grapple attempt against the target using your tail. Until this grapple ends you cannot constrict another target.
		
***Poison Immunity.*** You are immune to poison damage and can’t be poisoned.


***Poison Affinity.*** You gain proficiency in the poisoner’s kit.


***Languages.*** You can speak, read and write Vahcian and either Naga or Sahran.

# Fire Newts
Fire Newts orginal hail from the elemental plane of fire. Because of this fact firenewts are wowed by the most mundane of things found on the material plane. For instance firenewts throw outrageously large parties every night as they are unused to the idea of a nighttime.
Firenewts are about the size of a small human. They appear like lizardfolk with simpler faces and larger, dark-colored eyes. Their speckled, smooth skin appear eel-like and bears the color of flames. Firenewt colors have increasing rarity from red to yellow to white to blue. Even more rare are purple newts and above that green newts. Solid colored newts are very rare. There are not any known solid purple or green newts. Firenewts have long feet, giving them the appearance of "reversed knees".

Despite some misconceptions, firenewts are not infact releated to lizards and are instead more related to amphibians.

Firenewts require a source of magma in order to breed. When they do they deposit their clutch of eggs and leave their young to fend for themselves, because of this reason, Firenewts are far more communal seeing all newts as their family. 

Firenewts are known to carry around the ingredients to make an alchemical concoction made from mineral salts, sulfur and oil which they turn into a paste and chew as a habit to aid in their spitting of flames and warms them internally when away from a heat source or home. Firenewts have a great love of Alcohol, cheese and shiny materials such as gemstones. They have an especially large love of items that are green and purple.

# Water Newts
Waternewts are a race native to the plane of water. Waternewts constantly work torwards a deeper understanding of realty and what causes events to occur, they have dubbed this transcendent force "the current" and believe that this phenomenon is the reason behind every occcurance. Waternewts believe that nothing is above the force of the current, and even the dieties bend to this will. 

For many Waternewts, they establish a goal to seek early on in their lives, a project that they refer to as their Opus. Waternewts will spend nearly their entire lives working on their Opus, this project can range from attempting to uncover an artifact to creating the greatest flower garden ever made. In waternewt culture in order to ascend to the afterlife and have eternal happiness they complete this project.

The process by which a waternewt picks their Opus is largely out of their control, A waternewts Opus comes to them early on via a dream, a sign, or some other third party source. This event is believed by many waternewts to be predetermined and made aware to them by their races latent divination talents. Newts who don't recieve such a goal are considered abandoned by the "the current" and are cast out from society.

Waternewt cities are a confusing blend of canals, tunnels, and wide open spaces that randomly split between underwater spaces and above spaces making naviagting them difficult for those who are unable to breath underwater, waternewt currency is based on trade bars rather then gold.

## Barbarian Path: Path of the Battlerager (Rework)

### Battlerager Armor
When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use spiked armor as a weapon.



|Name | Cost | Armor Class | Weight| Type |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|
| Spiked Armor | 75 gp | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2)| 10 | Medium|

When you are wearing spiked armor, and holding nothing in your hands, or using a shield, you can use it as a weapon that has the heavy and two-handed properties. Additionally, while you are “wielding” the armor, you can still grapple other creatures. Magical spiked armor adds the magical bonus to AC to its attack rolls and damage rolls and counts as magical for the purposes for overcoming resistances and immunities.

The damage dice of the Spiked Armor starts at 1d6 and increases as you gain levels in this subclass.
The damage dice changes to 1d8 at 6th level, 1d10 at 10th level, and 1d12 at 14th level.


Additionally, when you are grappling a creature, you can make an attack using your Spiked Armor as a bonus action against the grappled creature


### Reckless Abandon
Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.

Additionally, the damage dice of your spiked armor changes to 1d8


### Battlerager Charge
Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging. If you dash as a bonus action and attack a creature on the same turn, you can attempt to grapple the creature one time for free.

Additionally, the damage dice of your spiked armor changes to 1d10


### Spiked Retribution
Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d12 piercing damage if you are raging, aren't incapacitated, and are wearing spiked armor. If you are wearing magical spiked armor, this damage counts as magical, but you do not add any extra damage to the effect.

Additionally, the damage dice of your spiked armor changes to 1d12

## Barbarian Path: Path of Berzerker (Rework)
<div class='descriptive'>
##### Two versions, for everyone.
On our server, we have two approved versions of the Battle Rager rework. Both are valid for use in play. However, you mus use one of them. In addition, we have removed the race restriciton that you can only be a dwarf, meaning you can play this subclass with whatever player race you want.

If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creatures until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if a creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

---
If a creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

## Paladin - Oath of The Warden

The Oath of the Warden was founded after a schism in the Oath of the Watchers paladins. The members of what would become the Wardens believed that Oath of the Watchers did not go far enough to prevent extraplanar incursions, and that their principles and morals limited their capabilities. Dressed in unassuming grey, each warden operates in the shadows, dispensing righteous fury before the enemy even knows what hit them.  They are closely associated with the shadowy organization known as The Ministry.

#### Tenets of The Warden:
___
**Secure the Future.** You are the thin line between the material plane and fiendish takeover. All that stand in your way are accessory to the apocalypse and must be cast aside. Mercy, compassion, and justice are not principles, but tools to be discarded at your convenience.
___

your choice other than the creature targeted with the attack
within the affected area take radiant damage equal to the
radiant damage dealt by the attack.
___
• At the start of each of your turns, you gain a bonus to your
weapon attack and damage rolls equal to your Charisma
modifier, which lasts until the start of your next turn. This
benefit ends if you move or take any actions other than
making weapon attacks.
___
• When you kill a creature you can see, you can take a
reaction to seal its soul with a holy glyph that appears on

## Wizard - Order of Entropy
For most wizards channeling the weave is as far as they go. However some wizards dig deeper, channeling a different yet familar energy. Entropy, a force that acts against the weave and magic, the wizards who walk this path balance on a knifes edge. For some this is a means to an end, they don't dig much deeper then the basics but for others they dig even deeper, leeching off the weave to channel powerful forces, forces that are regularly used to strike down the very ones who make regular use of the Weave.


#### Entropic Bolt
At 2nd level you gain the ability to channel the latent force of entropy. You gain access to the firebolt cantrip with the following changes;
it deals force instead of fire damage, its range is reduced to 60 feet, and it is unnaffected by counterspell or antimagic field during its casting.


#### Weave Theft
Also at 2nd level you are not bound by many of the rules that affect most spellcasters. Select a cantrip and 1st level spell of your choice from any class to take. You prepare this spell as normal, it uses intelligence rather then its normal casting ability, and it is treated as a wizard spell for you. Additionally The spells you learn at 7th, and 14th level can come from any classes spell list. You prepare these spells as normal and it uses intelligence rather then its normal casting ability.

#### Entropic Build Up
At 6th level you grow more in tune with the entropic forces of reality, you are able to turn the weapons of your enemy against them. 
When counterspelling or dispelling a spell you gain an amount of Entropic tokens equal to half of the dispelled spells level rounded up with a minimum of 1 token. You can have a maximum number of tokens equal to your double your proficency modifer.

As a bonus action you can spend entropic tokens to restore a spell slot equal to half the entropic tokens spent rounded up. The highest spellslot you can restore is 5th level.

Additionally the damage dice for the cantrip granted by Entropic Bolt increases from D10 to D12.

#### Carve the Weave
Your grip over entropy has strengthened to the point that your very magic is infused with it. At 10th level when you cast a spell you can use your reaction to spend a entropic token to channel entropic energies rather then the weave. Spells cast this way are unaffected by counterspell or antimagic field.

#### Rebuke the Weave
At 14th level as a bonus action, you may expend a spell slot of 7th level or higher to enter an entropic state of being. For one minute you gain a limited magic resistance granting the following effects
- If you are targeted or effected by a spell of third level or lower it instead has no effect for the duration. this effect is increased to 4th level with a 8th level slot consumed and 5th level with a 9th level slot consumed. 
- Your entropic bolt gains advantage on all attack rolls.
	
- The only spell you may cast is entropic bolt, however the number of times you may cast it with the same action increases according to the spell slot consumed to activate this state as follows: Twice total for 7th level, three times total for 8th level, and 4 times for 9th level.
- Finally you gain a 10ft flying (hover speed) but only if activated with a 9th level slot

When this state ends you gain 2 points of exhaustion.

- **Range:** Self 
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Artificer, Cleric, Wizard

---

Metal coats the skin of the caster as they begin casting, and they can then choose to make a special unarmed strike attack against a creature within 5ft. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage (recieving no bonus from strength or casting modifier, just to be in line with other cantrips) as the steely hide of the caster's fist slams into them.

Hit or miss, the user gains temporary hit points equal to their spellcasting ability modifier until the beginning of their next turn. The quantity of temporary hit points gained cannot be increased by any means. However, they have disadvantage on Dexterity Saving Throws and their movement speed is reduced by 5ft. 

---
The spell's damage increases by 1d6 and the temporary hit points granted increase by your spellcasting ability modifier when you reach 5th level (2d6 and 2 times spellcasting ability modifier THP), 11th level (3d6 and 3 times spellcasting ability modifier THP), and 17th level (4d6 and 4 times spellcasting ability modifier THP).

### Devils of the Dunes
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V,S,M (3 gemstones worth 50g each)
- **Duration:** 1 minute, concentration
- **Classes:** Wizard

Summon 1 dust mephit as part of the action to cast this spell, as a bonus action on subsequent turns an additional mephit can be summoned up to a maximum of 3 at once. If the spell ends the mephits die. The colour of the gems used determines the eye colour of the mephits.

___
**At higher levels.** when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher the maximum amount of mephits summoned at once increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.
	
<div class='descriptive'>
The above spell is heretical. Being caught using it will incur consequences from the Church of Eli if the caster is found out.
</div>
	
### Elder Sign
___
*3rd-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (special ink or tools worth 500 gp,
which the spell consumes), D (up to 5 feet across, on
object touched)
- **Duration:** Until Dispelled
- **Classes**: Wizards, Sorcerers
- **Subclasses**: Cleric (Arcana Domain), Warlock (Pact of the Undying)
___
You create an Elder Sign on an object you touch. The Elder
Sign is immune to the damage, spells, and abilities from
any CR 20+ aberrations, or creatures bound to
their service. These creatures can’t touch or pass through
an object with the Elder Sign. Generally, an Elder Sign is
destroyed after being within 30 feet of a CR 20+ aberration
for more than 5 continuous rounds. Note that since only
the Elder Sign itself has immunity to various alien horrors,
its protection can be unreliable. For example, a shield with
the Elder Sign drawn on it would not be affected by a Great
Old One’s attack, but the monster could still strike the bearer
if it avoids striking the shield (and thus the bearer’s AC is
not any higher than it would be with an unmarked shield).
Engraving the sign upon a door or on an archway prevents
such creatures from passing through the portal.

___
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, you can create an Elder Sign
with a radius of up to 5 feet, plus 5 feet per level of the
spell slot above 3rd.

	<br>
	
### Gallow tree
*4th-level conjuration (ritual)*
___
- **Casting time:** 1 action

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Classes:** Warlock, Wizard


One creature you can see must make a wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it becomes mystically linked to a structure or tree of your choosing on the same plane. If the creature dies during the duration of the spell, its body is instantly teleported to the structure or tree and bound to it by stout ropes.

<div class='descriptive'>
The above spell is heretical. Being caught using it will incur consequences from the Church of Eli if the caster is found out.
</div>
	
### Skeletal Deliquesce 
*8th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a cube of gelatin)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
- **Classes**: Wizards, Sorcerers

Description: You attempt to reduce a flesh-and-blood creature you can see within range to a quivering mass of meat by removing its skeleton. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its skeleton vanish, falling prone and becoming unable to stand up. A creature with its skeleton so vanished has its speed reduced to 10 feet and can not cast spells, attack, or perform any action that requires the use of its limbs. On each of its turns, the target can use an action to attempt a DC 16 Constitution ability check, restoring its skeleton on a success and ending the effect.
	

### Mori Memento
*4th-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V,S,M (a strand of hair or drop of blood from the target)
- **Duration:** instantaneous

If at the time of actually dying, the creature was told his death saves and is under the effects of something that would help or hinder that roll, simply make the addition/subtraction to the next predetermined roll or in the case that something gives advantage/disadvantage, roll a second dice and take the appropriate number. This spell has no effect on creatures that lack the ability to make death saves.
