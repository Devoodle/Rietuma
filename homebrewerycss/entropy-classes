### Order of Entropy - Wizard
For most wizards channeling the weave is as far as they go. However some wizards dig deeper, channeling a different yet familar energy. Entropy, a force that acts against the weave and magic, the wizards who walk this path balance on a knifes edge. For some this is a means to an end, they don't dig much deeper then the basics but for others they dig even deeper, leeching off the weave to channel powerful forces, forces that are regularly used to strike down the very ones who make regular use of the Weave.


#### Entropic Bolt
At 2nd level you gain the ability to channel the latent force of entropy. You gain access to the firebolt cantrip with the following changes;
it deals force instead of fire damage, its range is reduced to 60 feet, and it is unnaffected by counterspell or antimagic field during its casting.


#### Weave Theft
Also at 2nd level you are not bound by many of the rules that affect most spellcasters. Select a cantrip and 1st level spell of your choice from any class to take. You prepare this spell as normal, it uses intelligence rather then its normal casting ability, and it is treated as a wizard spell for you. Additionally The spells you learn at 7th, and 14th level can come from any classes spell list. You prepare these spells as normal and it uses intelligence rather then its normal casting ability.

#### Entropic Build Up
At 6th level you grow more in tune with the entropic forces of reality, you are able to turn the weapons of your enemy against them. 
When counterspelling or dispelling a spell you gain an amount of Entropic tokens equal to half of the dispelled spells level rounded up with a minimum of 1 token. You can have a maximum number of tokens equal to your double your proficency modifer.

As a bonus action you can spend entropic tokens to restore a spell slot equal to half the entropic tokens spent rounded up. The highest spellslot you can restore is 5th level.

Additionally the damage dice for the cantrip granted by Entropic Bolt increases from D10 to D12.

#### Carve the Weave
Your grip over entropy has strengthened to the point that your very magic is infused with it. At 10th level when you cast a spell you can use your reaction to spend a entropic token to channel entropic energies rather then the weave. Spells cast this way are unaffected by counterspell or antimagic field.

#### Rebuke the Weave
At 14th level as a bonus action, you may expend a spell slot of 7th level or higher to enter an entropic state of being. For one minute you gain a limited magic resistance granting the following effects
- If you are targeted or effected by a spell of third level or lower it instead has no effect for the duration. this effect is increased to 4th level with a 8th level slot consumed and 5th level with a 9th level slot consumed. 
- Your entropic bolt gains advantage on all attack rolls.
- The only spell you may cast is entropic bolt, however the number of times you may cast it with the same action increases according to the spell slot consumed to activate this state as follows: Twice total for 7th level, three times total for 8th level, and 4 times for 9th level.
- Finally you gain a 10ft flying (hover speed) but only if activated with a 9th level slot

When this state ends you gain 2 points of exhaustion.

### Void Singer - Rogue
For some fortune is what they seek, for others knowledge, and for others still power. Some would call what lurks within the void all three. Those who have delved deep enough to find it sing of what they found. 

#### Lessons of the Void
The whispers of Entropy teach you well. At 3rd level you gain proficency with medium armor, as well as proficiency with all martial and simple weapons.  

Additionally at 9th level you gain proficency with heavy armor and shields.

#### Fed by Blood
Entropy spurs you into battle, and it protects you from harm. At 3rd level when you hit with a sneak attack you may choose to deal half damage, if you do so, you gain temporary hitpoints equal to the damage dealt. You may use this ability a number of times equal your proficency modifier per long rest.

You also gain additional ways to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if 2 or more creatures are within 5 feet of you or a creature that is allied to the creature you are targeting is within 5 feet of that creature and you don't have disadvantage. Finally you can sneak attack with any martial weapon that lacks the reach or heavy property. All other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

#### Song of Recognition
Entropy croons, drawing the attention of all to you. At 9th level as a bonus action you may cause all creatures within 30 feet that are hostile to you to make a Charisma check contested by your own Charisma check. On a failure that creature has disadvantage on all attacks against creatures other then you, additionally allies have advantage against saving throws caused by said creature, This effect lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of their their turns they may repeat the saving throw. This effect ends if you move more then 15 feet from where you triggered it. You have one use of this, and gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level of this class. You regain any uses expended after a long rest.

#### Instrument of Death
Entropy sings and you are its instrument. At 13th level You gain profiency with Constitution saving throws.

Additonally While Song of Recognition is active, you gain advantage on all attacks against creatures effected by Song of Recognition that failed their saving throw. 



#### Choir of the Void
The whispers of entropy spill out into a chorus of song, you slide through reality striking at your foes regardless of distance. At 17th level when activating Song of Recognition you may choose to enter Choir of the Void. when you do so you gain the following abilities for one minute:
- Your speed falls to 0 feet.
- You gain infinite uses of Fed by Blood.
- Your AC is increased by 3
- As an action you can make a melee attack against a creature under the effects of Song of Recognition regardless of range.

As an action you can end this effect. After activating this feature you may not do so again until long rest.
